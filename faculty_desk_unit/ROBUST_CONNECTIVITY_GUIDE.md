## Troubleshooting Guide

### WiFi Connection Issues

#### Symptom: WiFi keeps disconnecting
**Diagnosis:**
- Check WiFi signal strength (RSSI should be > -75 dBm)
- Verify router stability and bandwidth
- Check for interference sources

**Solution:**
- Move ESP32 closer to router
- Use WiFi extender if needed
- Adjust `WIFI_MIN_RSSI` threshold if necessary

#### Symptom: WiFi connects but drops frequently
**Diagnosis:**
- Monitor connection quality percentage
- Check power management settings
- Verify router configuration

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Disable power saving for maximum stability
#define WIFI_POWER_SAVE_ENABLED false

// Increase connection quality threshold
#define CONNECTION_QUALITY_THRESHOLD 80
```

### MQTT Connection Issues

#### Symptom: MQTT shows connected but messages don't send
**Diagnosis:**
- Check message queue size
- Verify MQTT broker availability
- Monitor connection health

**Solution:**
- Check MQTT broker logs
- Verify topic permissions
- Increase `MQTT_BUFFER_SIZE` if needed

#### Symptom: MQTT disconnects frequently
**Diagnosis:**
- Check keepalive settings
- Monitor network latency
- Verify broker configuration

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Adjust keepalive interval
#define MQTT_KEEPALIVE 90  // Increase from 60 to 90 seconds

// Increase retry interval
#define MQTT_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS 12000  // Increase from 8 to 12 seconds
```

### Memory Issues

#### Symptom: System crashes or resets randomly
**Diagnosis:**
- Monitor free heap memory
- Check for memory leaks
- Verify watchdog operation

**Solution:**
- Enable watchdog monitoring
- Reduce message queue size if needed
- Check for memory leaks in custom code

### BLE Interference

#### Symptom: Network drops when BLE scanning
**Diagnosis:**
- Monitor scan frequency
- Check CPU usage
- Verify timing conflicts

**Solution:**
```cpp
// Reduce BLE scan frequency
#define BLE_SCAN_INTERVAL_SLOW 15000  // Increase from 10 to 15 seconds

// Optimize scan duration
#define BLE_SCAN_DURATION_QUICK 1     // Keep quick scans short
```
